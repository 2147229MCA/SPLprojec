      <h2>About our Main Content- Science Fiction!</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:100px;">Image</div>
      <p>What is Science Fiction? It's a genre of fiction that explores the possibilities and consequences of scientific discoveries, technological advances or social changes. We've seen some great examples of this recently in movies like Gravity and Interstellar, but there have been many others throughout history. In fact, it was science fiction that brought us the internet!

Science Fiction has always been part of our culture; we just didn't call it "science fiction" back then. The first recorded use of the term dates to 1845 when William Gibson published his novel A Novel without a Hero: Or, Makers of Romance. He called it "fantastic romance</p>

      <h3>Follow the RUles!- Anti Plagiarism Mandate!</h3>
      <p> I don't think it's a matter of being angry. I just think that if you are going to be in the business of writing, then you need to know what is plagiarism and how to avoid it. It is not something that can be ignored or swept under the rug, and it needs to be addressed head on.

What do you mean by "it"?

Plagiarism is when someone takes another personâ€™s work as his own and presents it as their own work without giving credit where credit is due. So Dont Plagiarise Content and Land Yourself in Trouble!</p>
